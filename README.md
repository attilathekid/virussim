# virussim
A agent based model of virus transmission based on COVID-19 using the mesa framework.
**Go to run.ipynb to explore the model.**

Based on an idea by Andre Vacha, COVID-19 has very different mortality rates for
people of different ages, but China is known for having a weird population pyramid. So,
we wrote this model to expiriment with other countries with different age distributions,
such as the United States. Although we collaborated on the whole program, he mostly 
worked on the visualizations and the web scaper, and I mostly worked on the backend.

Note: This isn't intended to make actual predictions about the world or anything, it's 
just a thought expiriment. Please don't sue me.
